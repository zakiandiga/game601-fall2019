        A modification to the traditional War card game. Unlike original War where both players cannot choose which card to use, Mindful War allows players to decide which card to reveal from the three cards on their hand. In addition, there are cards that have special abilities which can modify the board or players hand. With these modifications, players can challenge their strategic thinking ability, which hopefully adds the fun!

        This is a simple bullet hell game with a twist, where the player needs to control two different sprites with one command, simultaneously. Train your multi tasking ability!
		What Players need to do is to avoid the black obstacles that keep comming along the way, by moving left and right, relative to the sprite's direction.
